h1. Pongan : Controller

This project is one of the three projects made for the Global Google Tv Hackathon London
The overall idea of the project is a modern version of Loren Carpenterâ€™s crowd experiment

The controller is a simple android application, it gives you the choice between red and blue
and the you can controll the movement of the puddle up and down

Parts of the project are :

- android controller for mobiles

- google tv display for the pong game

https://github.com/luigi-agosti/pongan-display

- google appengine to manage communication with channel api

Please remember that the code is done during an hackathon and as such shouldn't be use for any business scenario
